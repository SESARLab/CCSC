This page contains a guide on how to execute experiments discussed in the paper  "A Cost-Effective Certification-Based Service Composition for the Cloud"

	Reuirements:
	
	- [Python 2.7] (https://github.com/fgaudenzi/testManager)

	- [GPLK]   (https://github.com/patriziotufarolo/testagent/tree/production)

	
Repository is organized in three main folders containing all building blocks and datasets at the basis of experimental evaluation and examples in the paper.

- Folder [DataSet](https://github.com/SESARLab/ccsc/tree/master/dataset) contains all datasets we have used for evaluation. 
- Folder [Optimum](https://github.com/SESARLab/ccsc/tree/master/optimum) contains the model to solve the ccsc problem using linear programming.
- Folder [Python](https://github.com/SESARLab/ccsc/tree/master/python) contains all python scripts to run our algorithm and to parse optimal and not results.
